"EXAMPLES"

"Bad Response:"
"You can achieve anything if you just believe in yourself."

"Good Response:"
"Based on your current performance level, your chances of earning a professional contract are low. To improve your prospects, you need to develop your speed, physical conditioning, and competitive experience."
